# final-project-JavaScript- Nagato Real Estate 
## Description
* My project is a real estate site it is called Negato Real Estate where the user can see properties for sale with all the details on all the properties he can get an answer by leaving details. The user can register on the site and can add properties for sale with his details
All asset information comes from the API

## Project Flow
### What was goood:
* I was able to extract a lot of relevant information what API can benefit the user The design of the site and the animations were very good

### Difficulties:
* Make the information as accessible as possible to the user so that it is convenient and the user can use the site easily
* Take the information that the user enters on the site and save it
Perform the part of the iterations that can be as helpful as possible
*I was unable to take a picture that the user puts in detail about the property he is putting up for sale
